Goals:
a.) General Hygene
b.) Physical Improvment
c.) Eating Healthy
d.) Scripture Study
e.) Personal Time

Tracks:
    a.) Consistent Daily Schedules
        Check Time that an activity was consistent, does it fall into the "grace period" for that activity. (allow a delay to be applied for any reason that pushs the schedules forward to overcome the delay)
        Points will be awarded based on how closely the time recorded fits to the target time (there will be a schduled "delay" to account for the time it takes to actually record).
        A user set "restart" period (every week, every month, every day) will reset the amount of "possible points" in the display record (i.e. 50/100 if they didn't hit the goals of two 25 point activities) 
    b.) Accomplishing physical workouts (regardless of whether it is in a schedule, this could be a way to improve your metric if you missed a few points in the schedule, increasing both possible and overall points to make the gap smaller relative to the total)
    c.) Eating Healthy will have bonus points (that do not contribute to total possible) simply by eating a more balenced meal with added benefits. (Total calories, macro-nutrients, etc.)
        Total calories will be calorie base (measured by activity level, weight, height, age, and gender) / number of meals scheduled in the day (recommended will be 5 meals)
            If you eat less than the recommended amount, but still greater than the BMR to not induce muscle loss and/or extreme fatigue and/or metabolic slowdown, will be rewarded bonus points measured by how close they maintain to the TDEE.
    d.) Scripture Study will be based on how much time is devoted to scripture study and how much stime was set aside to accomplish that goal.
    e.) Personal time will be rewarded when the user records that they spent time to relax and step away from their troubles.
